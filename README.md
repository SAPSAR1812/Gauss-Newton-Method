# Gauss-Newton-Method

Use Gauss Newton Method to fit data onto any equation of choice with two constant unknowns.
Function must be returned from function f.
Depeding on choice of function f store the partial derivatives of f with respect to a and b in f_a and f_b respectively.
Enter data set as a list of values. 
The code will also print R squared value of the fit.
